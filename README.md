# CSS snippets
In this repo, I've compiled some of the snippets I use to improve my default ObsidianMD setup. Credit for some sections are included in the comments within the CSS.
- **colorful.css** adds colors to the KanBan plugin, as well as the tab strip.
- **headings.css** changes heading colors for improved visibility
- **sleek.css** shifts the editor margins to the left to be more centered when the left sidebar is open
- **theorem.css** is a custom callout (not mine) that's useful for math notes
